# Execution Launcher
This is a program built to hold a collection of .exe files and allow you to run them directly from the application. Files grouped together into collections.

This is made in Python with tkinter as the basis for the GUI. The storage is done via an automatically updated JSON file that appears in the same folder as the script. Groups are deleted when all executables are deleted from it, they can also be deleted.

ChatGPT was used for most of the code, with small bits done by hand for bugfixing and small refinements.

I hope this is useful to somebody, it was certainly useful for me.
